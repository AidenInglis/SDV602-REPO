Problems:
1. Images haven't been added and are just too zoomed in or are default ones from the example.
2. you can go to room3 pickup the potion navigate around the map, press pickup again, it will then break the game.
3. When you press attack the details update correctly, but when you type attack and press enter the details don't update and then if you use the button method you need to press the enter button after the monster health is below 0 to be taken to the win screen.
